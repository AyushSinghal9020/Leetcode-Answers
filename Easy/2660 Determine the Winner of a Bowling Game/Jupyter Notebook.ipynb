        "### Problem Statement -\n",
        "\n",
        "You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `player1` and `player2`, that represent the number of pins that player 1 and player 2 hit in a bowling game, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "The bowling game consists of `n` turns, and the number of pins in each turn is exactly `10`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Assume a player hit `xi` pins in the `ith` turn. The value of the `ith` turn for the player is:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `2xi` if the player hit `10` pins in any of the previous two turns.\n",
        "* Otherwise, It is `xi`.\n",
        "The score of the player is the sum of the values of their `n` turns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Return\n",
        "\n",
        "* 1 if the score of player 1 is more than the score of player 2,\n",
        "* 2 if the score of player 2 is more than the score of player 1, and\n",

        "Explanation: The score of player1 is 4 + 10 + 2*7 + 2*9 = 46.\n",
        "The score of player2 is 6 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 16.\n",
        "Score of player1 is more than the score of player2, so, player1 is the winner, and the answer is 1.\n",

        "Output: 2\n",
        "\n",
        "Explanation: The score of player1 is 3 + 5 + 7 + 6 = 21.\n",
        "The score of player2 is 8 + 10 + 2*10 + 2*2 = 42.\n",
        "Score of player2 is more than the score of player1, so, player2 is the winner, and the answer is 2.\n",

        "Output: 0\n",
        "\n",
        "Explanation: The score of player1 is 2 + 3 = 5\n",
        "The score of player2 is 4 + 1 = 5\n",
        "The score of player1 equals to the score of player2, so, there is a draw, and the answer is 0.\n",
